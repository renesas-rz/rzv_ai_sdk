# Footfall Counter

## Application: Overview
This application is designed to track and count the number of people entering a designated boundary line,
while simultaneously reducing the count for those exiting the boundary line.

Additionally, the application 
has the ability to measure the time spent by a particular person within a specified region of interest.

This software could be useful in a variety of settings, such as retail stores, museums, and events,
where managers need to monitor and analyze traffic flow and customer behavior.

The AI model used for the sample application is [YOLOV3/Tiny YOLOv3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02767.pdf).

**NOTE:** This sample application can be used to track different objects, like animal, car, etc. The list of objects that can be tracked are provided in [coco labels txt](./exe/coco-labels-2014_2017.txt) file. 

It has following mode of running.

## Application: Build Stage

>**Note:** User can skip to the [next stage (deploy)](#application-deploy-stage) if they do not want to build the application.  
All pre-built binaries are provided.

### Prerequisites
This section expects the user to have completed Step 5 of [Getting Started Guide](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/latest/getting_started.html) provided by Renesas. 

After completion of the guide, the user is expected of following things.
- AI SDK setup is done.
- Following docker container is running on the host machine.
    |Board | Docker container |
    |:---|:---|
    |RZ/V2L EVK|`rzv2l_ai_sdk_container`  |
    |RZ/V2H EVK|`rzv2h_ai_sdk_container`  |
    |RZ/V2N EVK|`rzv2n_ai_sdk_container`  |

    >**Note 1:** Docker environment is required for building the sample application.  


### Application File Generation
1. On your host machine, copy the repository from the GitHub to the desired location. 
    1. It is recommended to copy/clone the repository on the `data` folder, which is mounted on the Docker container. 
    ```sh
    cd <path_to_data_folder_on_host>/data
    git clone https://github.com/renesas-rz/rzv_ai_sdk.git
    ```
    >Note: This command will download the whole repository, which include all other applications.  
    If you have already downloaded the repository of the same version, you may not need to run this command.  

2. Run (or start) the docker container and open the bash terminal on the container.  
E.g., for RZ/V2L, use the `rzv2l_ai_sdk_container` as the name of container created from  `rzv2l_ai_sdk_image` docker image.  
    > Note that all the build steps/commands listed below are executed on the docker container bash terminal.  

3. Set your clone directory to the environment variable.  
    ```sh
    export PROJECT_PATH=/drp-ai_tvm/data/rzv_ai_sdk
    ```
4. Go to the application source code directory.  
    ```sh
    cd ${PROJECT_PATH}/Q01_footfall_counter/src
    ```
5. Create and move to the `build` directory.
    ```sh
    mkdir -p build && cd build
    ``````
6. Build the application by following the commands below.  
    ```sh
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./toolchain/runtime.cmake ..
    make -j$(nproc)
    ```
   
7. The following application file would be generated in the `${PROJECT_PATH}/Q01_footfall_counter/src/build` directory
    - object_tracker

    <!-- On application window, following information is displayed.  
    - Camera capture  
    - AI result 
    - Processing time  
        - Total AI Time: Sum of all processing time below.  
        - Inference: Processing time taken for AI inference.  
        - PreProcess: Processing time taken for AI pre-processing.  
        - PostProcess: Processing time taken for AI post-processing.<br>(excluding the time for drawing on HDMI screen).   -->
        
      - The application will track the person if the person crossed the `red line` and increment the `human count` and decrement it when the person crosses again.
      - As per current logic, left to right crossing will increment the human count, and right to left crossing will decrement the count.
      - Users need to arrange the line according to the requirement.
      - The application will also keep track of the person in the available region `green box` and increment the `person in region` count. It will also decrement the count if the person leaves the area.
      - Each person tracked is given a unique `id`.
          - The `time` parameter of the tracked person indicates the time spent on the desired location. This incremented at regular interval.

5. To terminate the application, double click the application window.

### Explanation of the `config.ini` file 

The file contains two sections: [**tracking**] and [**display**].

- The [**tracking**] section contains three key-value pairs.\
The conf value is a confidence threshold used for object tracking, and the kmin value is the minimum number of key-points required for tracking. The objects value is for the class that should be tracked.

>**Note:** The object tracked here is of class "Person", it can be changed to other classes present on the coco labels.

- The [**display**] section contains two key-value pairs.\
The display_text and region_display_text is for the texts that should be displayed in UI.

To modify the configuration settings, edit the values in this file using VI Editor, from the Board.

### Time Tracking Backend Integration

>**Note:**  As per recent development status, the application have been tested for 100 numbers of people on the certain region without any error occurring, so if the use cases are expected for the number of people on the certain region to be less than 100, there is no need for code modification.

- Currently for storing the person id and the time spent on the region of interest [ROI] is stored on the board memory as key-value pair. As board memory consumption is limited, this procedure could be moved to the Database/Cache which could be hosted on the cloud or host machine.

- Customers can install SQL Database/Cache on the cloud or host-machine. 

- After each sec the application can call the API for inserting the data on the DB, if not present. and show the time taken for the persons in the ROI

- When the person goes out of the ROI, the application can call the API to remove the person data from the DB and cache.

## Reference
- For RZ/V2H EVK and RZ/V2N EVK, this application supports USB camera only with 640x480 resolution.
